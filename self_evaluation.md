I did struggle with arrays a bit, not the most confident but I have a good enough grasp so far to work through the steps and come to what appears to be a proper conclusion, even after having to restart from scratch once. 

I think simply doing more arrays as we work through more tasks will aid in getting a better understanding of how arrays function. 

Should I have been completing the arrays examples in VS code or through the irb function in the Terminal?

I provided the examples as asked to the file in VS Code but wondering if I was mistaken there. Otherwise, how the arrays function seems to be more clear now after some practice.
